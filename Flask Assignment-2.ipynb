    "GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. It retrieves data from the server without altering the server's state.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Data is appended to the URL in the form of query parameters.\n",
    "Data is visible in the URL, which makes it less secure for sensitive information.\n",
    "GET requests are idempotent, meaning making the same request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once.\n",
    "Caching is possible as the response to a GET request can be cached by the browser.\n",
    "Generally used for retrieving information, such as viewing web pages or fetching data from an API.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "GET /search?query=example HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: www.example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It can modify the server's state by creating or updating resources.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Data is sent in the body of the request, not appended to the URL, which makes it more secure for sensitive information.\n",
    "Data is not visible in the URL, but it's still possible to intercept it if not encrypted.\n",
    "POST requests are not idempotent, meaning making the same request multiple times can have different effects, such as creating duplicate records.\n",
    "Responses are typically not cached by browsers, as the effect of the request might change server-side state.\n",
    "Commonly used for submitting forms, sending data to an API for creating or updating resources.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    POST /submit HTTP/1.1\n",
    "    Host: www.example.com\n",
    "    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n",

    "In Flask, the request object is used to handle incoming HTTP requests made by clients (typically web browsers) to \n",
    "your web application. It provides a way to access various data and information associated with the incoming request, \n",
    "allowing you to process and respond to the request effectively. The request object is an integral part of building\n",
    "dynamic web applications and APIs using Flask. Here's why the request object is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Request Data: The request object allows you to access data sent by the client in the request, such as\n",
    "form data, query parameters, headers, cookies, and more. This data is crucial for processing user input and making \n",
    "decisions about how to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing Form Data: When users submit forms on a web page, the request object can be used to extract the data \n",
    "from the form fields, enabling you to process the form submissions and take appropriate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Parameters: The request object helps you access query parameters included in the URL of the request. These\n",
    "parameters are often used for customizing the behavior of your application or API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers and Cookies: You can use the request object to retrieve HTTP headers and cookies sent by the client. This\n",
    "information can be used for authentication, tracking user sessions, and other purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Uploads: If your application allows file uploads, the request object provides methods to handle uploaded \n",
    "files and access their data."

    "In Flask, the redirect() function is used to perform a redirection from one URL to another. It's a way to guide\n",

    "your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Form Submission: After a user submits a form on a web page, you might want to redirect them to a different\n",

    "Authentication and Authorization: When a user tries to access a restricted resource without being authenticated,\n",
